Title: Tamagotchi App Overview

Description:
This repository contains the source code for a Tamagotchi-like Android application. It consists of two main activities: MainActivity and MainActivity2. Each activity represents different aspects of the virtual pet's care, including feeding, cleaning, and playing.

MainActivity:

Functionality:
Initializes UI components such as TextView, ImageView, and Button.
Enables edge-to-edge display.
Provides functionality to restart the activity upon clicking the button.
MainActivity2:

Functionality:
Initializes UI components such as ImageView, Buttons, and ProgressBars.
Enables edge-to-edge display.
Implements actions for feeding, cleaning, and playing with the virtual pet.
Usage:

This project can be used to create a virtual pet simulation app on Android devices.
Developers can customize the UI elements, add more features, and enhance the gameplay experience based on their requirements.
Additional Notes:

Ensure that the layout XML files (activity_main.xml and activity_main2.xml) contain the necessary UI elements with the specified IDs.
Developers can replace the placeholder images (R.drawable.eating, R.drawable.playing, R.drawable.bathing) with actual images representing the virtual pet's activities.
The progress bars (Feedbar, Cleanbar, Playbar) increment by 50 units upon clicking the corresponding buttons. Developers can adjust the increment value as needed.
Dependencies:

This project relies on the AndroidX library for AppCompatActivity and edge-to-edge display functionality.
